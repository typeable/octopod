_Octopod_ is a fully open-source self-hosted solution for managing multiple deployments in a _Kubernetes_ cluster with a user-friendly web interface. Managing deployments does not require any technical expertise.

We created _Octopod_ because we believe that everything we release should be rigorously tested, however, such desires greatly [complicate the development workflow](docs/en/PM_case_study.md) leading to longer release cycles. We use _Octopod_ to mitigate the downsides of rigorously testing each feature by deploying every single change we make to a separate staging environment allowing QA to investigate each feature independently and in parallel.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è FAQ

### How long does it take to set up _Octopod_?

The longest part of setting up _Octopod_ for your project will probably be writing [_Control Scripts_][cs]. In total you should be able to get things running in about a day.

### Will _Octopod_ work with my project if it uses X?

Yes. _Octopod_ is project-agnostic. If you can run your project in a Docker container, then you can use _Octopod_ with that project.

### What do I need to know to set up Octopod?

You need to understand the basics of _Kubernetes_ and be familiar with whatever hosting provider you will be using. There is no need to know any special language ‚Äì you can write [_Control Scripts_][cs] in whatever language you like.

### Does _Octopod_ work with my CI?

Yes. If you can run arbitrary executables in your CI, then you will be able to integrate it with _Octopod_. Integration basically consists of calling our _octo CLI_ tool to perform desired actions. You can find more detail in the [CI integration](docs/en/Integration.md) doc.

### How come I can't see the deployment logs in Octopod web app?

It's been excluded from the GUI because we don't have a good security story to accompany this feature yet. Some secrets and credentials may leak to the project team using Octopod and, potentially, not everyone should have access to this data.

### Octopod says "Failure" next to my deployment. Why is it not working?

There are several places where things can go wrong:

1. Your DevOps engineer could have made mistakes in one of the [_Control Scripts_][cs] leading to an improper deployment process.

   To fix this the DevOps engineer can use the [_octo CLI_][octo] to see detailed logs collected during the deployment process and diagnose the issue.
2. You could have one of the steps of your deployment failing (for example, a failing database migration).

   If you have supplied a [_Kubernetes Dashboard_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) URL to _Octopod_ during deployment, then you will have a "Details" button in the _Web UI_. You can click that button to get a filtered view of the _Kubernetes Dashboard_ where you can see what could have gone wrong and diagnose the issue.

### Why Haskell and Rust?

We believe that there is a lot to be gained in programming in general by being able to statically ensure invariants in your code. One of the most practical ways of ensuring invariants is a good static type system. Haskell and Rust are both languages that have very strong type systems. This allows us to move fast without breaking things in the process.
